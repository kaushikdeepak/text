# The Road not taken by Robert Frost  
                                   THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
                                          -Robert frost
                            Two roads diverged in yellow wood
                            and sorry I could not travelled both
                            and be one traveller ,long I stood
                            and looked down one as faras I could
                            To where it bent in the undergrowth
                            Then took the other, as just as fair
                            and having perhaps the better claim
                            Because it was graspy and wanted wear
                            though as for that the passing there
                            Had worn them really about the same,
                            and both that morning equally lay
                            In leave no step had trodden black
                            oh! I kept the first for another day!
                            Yet knowing know way leads onto way,
                            I doubted if I should ever come back,
                            I shall be telling this with a sigh
                            somewhere ages and ages hence,
                            Two roads diverged in a wood and I,
                            I took the one less travelled by,
                            and that made all the difference......
                         The same is happening with us at the time when we have to decide for science and commerce
